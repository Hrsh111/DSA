 * LeetCode #417 - Pacific Atlantic Water Flow
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/pacific-atlantic-water-flow/
 *
 * There is an m x n rectangular island that borders both the Pacific Ocean and
 * Atlantic Ocean. The Pacific Ocean touches the island's left and top edges, and
 * the Atlantic Ocean touches the island's right and bottom edges.
 *
 * The island is partitioned into a grid of square cells. You are given an m x n
 * integer matrix heights where heights[r][c] represents the height above sea
 * level of the cell at coordinate (r, c).
 *
 * The island receives a lot of rain, and the rain water can flow to neighboring
 * cells directly north, south, east, and west if the neighboring cell's height
 * is less than or equal to the current cell's height. Water can flow from any
 * cell adjacent to an ocean into the ocean.
 *
 * Return a 2D list of grid coordinates result where result[i] = [ri, ci] denotes
 * that rain water can flow from cell (ri, ci) to both the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: heights = [[1,2,2,3,5],[3,2,3,4,4],[2,4,5,3,1],[6,7,1,4,5],[5,1,1,2,4]]
 * Output: [[0,4],[1,3],[1,4],[2,2],[3,0],[3,1],[4,0]]
 * Explanation: The following cells can flow to the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: heights = [[1]]
 * Output: [[0,0]]
 * Explanation: The water can flow from the only cell to both the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.
 *
 * Constraints:
 * - m == heights.length
 * - n == heights[r].length
 * - 1 <= m, n <= 200
 * - 0 <= heights[r][c] <= 10^5
