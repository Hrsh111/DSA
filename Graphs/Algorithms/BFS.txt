# For making a bfs things that need to keep in mind 
1. It takes a starting node to start the traversal void(int startnode).
2. It requires an adjacency matrix to check which node has an edge between them void(vector<vector<int>>&adj)
3. It needs a visited array to mark the nodes that once visited.
4. Make a queue and store the visited node in it and them perform whatever operation we want to 
5. perform on it 
#syntax: 
queue<int> q; # intialized the queue 
q.push(startnode) // The node has been pushed
visited[startnode]// node has been marked as visited
6. Now perform the traversal 
while(!q.empty()){
    int curr= q.front();// now we have stored the front element of the queue in the current varibale 
    q.pop();// poping the node as we have stored it already 

    for(int i=0; i<=adj.size();i++ ){// running the for loop to check one by one for each of the nodes 
        if(adj[curr][i]==1 && !visited[i]){
            q.push[i];
            visited[i]=true;
        }
    }

}
